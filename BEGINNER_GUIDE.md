# 🌟 Beginner's Guide to Peru 2040: Open-Source National Strategy

**Welcome!** This guide explains everything you need to know about contributing to Peru's national strategy - even if you've never used GitHub or heard of "open source" before.

---

## 🤔 **What is Open Source?**

Think of **open source** like a community cookbook:

### 📚 **Traditional Cookbook (Closed Source)**
- One chef writes all the recipes
- You can read the cookbook, but can't change anything
- If there's a mistake, only the chef can fix it
- Limited to the chef's knowledge and experience

### 👥 **Community Cookbook (Open Source)**  
- **Anyone can contribute** recipes and improvements
- **Everyone can see** all recipes and suggestions
- **Best ideas win** - the community decides what works
- **Mistakes get fixed quickly** by many people checking the work
- **Final result is better** because it uses everyone's knowledge

**Peru 2040 is like a community cookbook for Peru's future!**

---

## 💻 **What is GitHub?**

**GitHub** is like a **digital workspace** where people collaborate on projects. Think of it as:

### 🏢 **A Digital Office Building**
```mermaid

    A[🏢 GitHub - The Building] --> B[📁 Peru Repository - Our Office]
    B --> C[📄 Documents - Strategy Files]
    B --> D[💬 Issues - Discussion Rooms]
    B --> E[🗣️ Discussions - Meeting Rooms]
    B --> F[📝 Pull Requests - Suggestion Box]
```

### 🗂️ **What's Inside Our "Office"**
- **📄 Documents**: The strategy documents (like Word docs, but everyone can edit)
- **💬 Issues**: Discussion rooms for specific topics (like "Energy Strategy")
- **🗣️ Discussions**: General meeting rooms for broader conversations
- **📝 Pull Requests**: Suggestion box for changes to documents
- **👥 Contributors**: List of everyone helping with the project

## 🚀 **How to Get Started (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account (2 minutes)**

```mermaid

    A[Go to GitHub.com] --> B[Click 'Sign Up']
    B --> C[Choose Username]

```

**Just like creating any online account** - email, password, username. **It's completely free!**

1. **Go to**: `github.com/MRCORD/peru`
2. **Click "Watch"** to get notifications about updates
3. **Click "Star"** to bookmark the project (like a Facebook "like")

### **Step 3: Start Reading and Exploring (10 minutes)**

## 💬 **How to Contribute (Choose Your Level)**

### **🟢 Level 1: Super Easy (5 minutes)**
**Perfect for beginners - just add your thoughts!**

#### **Comment on an Issue**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant GitHub
    participant Community
    
    You->>GitHub: 1. Click on an Issue
    You->>GitHub: 2. Scroll to bottom
    You->>GitHub: 3. Type your comment
    You->>GitHub: 4. Click "Comment"
    GitHub->>Community: 5. Everyone sees your input!
```

**Example**: 
- Go to Issue #5 (Energy Strategy)
- Scroll to the bottom
- Type: "I think solar energy is great for Peru because..." 
- Click "Comment"
- **Done!** You just contributed to national strategy planning!

### **🟡 Level 2: Easy (15 minutes)**
**Share your expertise or ask questions**

#### **Create a New Discussion**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Click 'Discussions' Tab] --> B[Click 'New Discussion']
    B --> C[Choose Category]
    C --> D[Write Your Question/Idea]
    D --> E[Click 'Start Discussion']
```

**Examples of good discussions**:
- "I work in renewable energy - here's what I think about Peru's potential"
- "I'm from Arequipa - here's what would work in southern Peru"
- "I studied economics - here are some concerns about the financial projections"

### **🟠 Level 3: Intermediate (30 minutes)**
**Make specific suggestions for improvements**

#### **Create a New Issue**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Click 'Issues' Tab] --> B[Click 'New Issue']
    B --> C[Choose Template]
    C --> D[Fill Out Template]
    D --> E[Add Labels]
    E --> F[Submit Issue]
    F --> G[Community Discusses]
    G --> H[Improvements Made]
```

**Use this when you**:
- **Spot a problem**: "The energy projections seem too optimistic"
- **Have expertise**: "As a mining engineer, I think we're missing..."
- **Know better examples**: "Singapore did this differently, and here's why..."

### **🔴 Level 4: Advanced (1+ hours)**
**Propose changes to the actual strategy documents**

#### **Submit a Pull Request**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Find Document to Change] --> B[Click Edit ✏️]
    B --> C[Make Your Changes]
    C --> D[Describe Changes]
    D --> E[Submit Pull Request]
    E --> F[Community Reviews]
    F --> G{Approved?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Changes Added to Strategy]
    G -->|No| I[Revise and Resubmit]
```

**Use this when you want to**:
- **Add missing information**: New data, studies, examples
- **Fix errors**: Incorrect statistics, broken links, typos
- **Improve clarity**: Better explanations, clearer language

## 🗣️ **Communication Guide**

### **How to Write Good Comments**

#### **✅ Good Examples**:
- **Be specific**: "Based on my experience in solar energy in Chile, Peru could achieve 15 GW solar by 2035 because..."
- **Provide evidence**: "According to this World Bank report [link], similar projects cost 20% less than estimated"
- **Ask clarifying questions**: "What assumptions are we making about copper prices in this projection?"
- **Share local knowledge**: "In Cusco, the main challenge would be transportation, not technology"

#### **❌ Avoid These**:
- **Vague criticism**: "This won't work"
- **Personal attacks**: "This person doesn't know what they're talking about"
- **Off-topic discussions**: Discussing other countries' politics
- **Unconstructive negativity**: "Peru can never do this"

### **Tags and Mentions**

#### **How to Get Attention**:
- **Tag the project owner**: `@MRCORD` - he'll respond within 48 hours
- **Tag other experts**: `@username` if you want their opinion on something
- **Use issue numbers**: "This relates to #5" - creates automatic links

#### **How to Find People**:
- **Check CONTRIBUTORS.md**: List of people by expertise area
- **Look at issue comments**: See who's active in discussions that interest you
