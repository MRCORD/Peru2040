# International Partnerships Framework
## Strategic Technology Cooperation for Peru 2040

### Overview

Peru's technological transformation requires strategic partnerships with nations that have successfully navigated similar economic transitions. This framework establishes comprehensive cooperation agreements with four key partner countries, each contributing specialized expertise and resources to accelerate Peru's development trajectory (OECD, 2023).

The international partnership strategy leverages proven transformation models while ensuring Peru maintains technological sovereignty and long-term strategic autonomy (World Economic Forum, 2024).
