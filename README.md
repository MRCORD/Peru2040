## 2. Strategic Context and Rationale

### 2.1 The 21st Century Reality

The global economy is undergoing a fundamental transformation driven by artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing (Schwab, 2017). Nations that control these technologies will dominate global value chains, while those that remain dependent on raw material exports will face perpetual economic subordination (UNCTAD, 2021).

### 2.2 The Commodity Trap

Peru currently finds itself at a critical juncture. Despite being among the world's top producers of copper, silver, gold, and lithium—all essential materials for the technology revolution—Peru captures minimal value from these resources (USGS, 2024).

#### 2.2.1 Current Economic Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Impact | Evidence |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Export Dependency** | Price volatility exposure | 63.9% of exports are minerals (BCRP, 2024) |
| **Limited Value Addition** | Low profit margins | Most exports are raw/semi-processed (Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2024) |
| **Technological Dependence** | Strategic vulnerability | Critical infrastructure relies on foreign suppliers (CEPLAN, 2023) |
| **Human Capital Flight** | Reduced innovation capacity | High-skilled workforce emigrates (IOM, 2023) |

### 2.3 The Strategic Imperative

Technological sovereignty has become a national security imperative (Baldwin, 2020). Countries without indigenous capabilities in AI, nuclear energy, and advanced manufacturing face:

#### 2.3.1 Economic Subordination
- Permanent position as raw material suppliers
- Vulnerability to commodity price volatility
- Limited policy options for economic development
- Inability to capture value from domestic resources

#### 2.3.2 Security Vulnerabilities
- Dependence on foreign technology for critical infrastructure
- Communications and data systems subject to foreign control
- Energy systems vulnerable to supply disruptions
- Defense capabilities dependent on foreign suppliers

#### 2.3.3 Political Constraints
- Limited policy autonomy due to economic dependencies
- Vulnerability to economic coercion by advanced nations
- Inability to pursue independent foreign policy
- Domestic instability due to economic underdevelopment
