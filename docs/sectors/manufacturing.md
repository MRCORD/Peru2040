# Advanced Manufacturing Strategy

This document outlines Peru's strategy for transforming from raw material exporter to advanced manufacturing powerhouse, creating high-value products and capturing maximum value from natural resources. According to recent data from the Banco Central de Reserva del PerÃº (BCRP, 2024), Peru's industrial production has shown robust growth of 11.8% year-over-year, providing a strong foundation for manufacturing expansion.

## Strategic Vision

Transform Peru into Latin America's advanced manufacturing hub by 2040, leveraging the projected 2.8% GDP growth in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025 (Fitch Solutions, 2024) to achieve the following targets:
- Process 80% of mineral production domestically
- Develop world-class capabilities in electronics, automotive, and aerospace sectors
- Increase manufacturing value-added contribution to GDP from current 12.3% to 25% by 2040
- Create 500,000+ high-skilled manufacturing jobs

## Core Manufacturing Transformation
